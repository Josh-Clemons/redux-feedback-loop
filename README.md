The Feedback Submitting Thing 

## Description

This project gathers feedback from the user, a 1-5 value for:
 - How a user is feeling
 - Material Understanding
 - Level of Support
 - As well as a general text field for 'comments'. 

After feedback is gathered, it is displayed on a new page where a user can review and submit to the database.

Once submission is complete the user receives confirmation and has an option to create another feedback form.
